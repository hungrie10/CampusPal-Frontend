# 🚀 Chat Server (Gemini + WebSockets)

## 📌 Overview
This server powers real-time chat functionality using **WebSockets** and integrates with **Google Gemini AI** to generate intelligent responses.

It acts as the backend engine that:
- Handles real-time communication between clients
- Processes user messages
- Sends prompts to Gemini AI
- Returns AI-generated responses instantly

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Node.js** – Backend runtime
- **Express.js** – Server framework
- **WebSocket / Socket.IO** – Real-time communication
- **Gemini AI API** – AI response generation
- **MongoDB (optional)** – Chat/message storage
- **JWT (optional)** – Authentication

## 🔌 How It Works

### 1. Client Connection
- Client connects via WebSocket  
- Server listens for connection events  

### 2. Message Flow
1. User sends a message  
2. Server receives it via socket  
3. Message is forwarded to Gemini AI  
4. Gemini processes and returns a response  
5. Server emits response back to client in real-time
